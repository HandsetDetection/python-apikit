This is a Python module exposing the Handset Detection A\+P\+I version 2.\+0. If you aren't sure what that means, please visit \href{http://handsetdetection.com/}{\tt http\+://handsetdetection.\+com/} and then read this document.

\subsection*{A\+P\+I }

The A\+P\+I for handsetdetection.\+com is quite simple. There are four available methods\+: detect, model, track, and vendor.

detect(data, options) Get device information and capabilities given sufficient idenifying information, such as a user-\/agent or x-\/wap-\/profile.

data -\/ a dictionary containing a User-\/\+Agent, I\+P address, x-\/wap-\/profile, and any other information that may be useful in identifying the handset options -\/ a string or list of options to be returned from your query, e.\+g., \char`\"{}geoip,product\+\_\+info,display\char`\"{} or \mbox{[}\char`\"{}geoip\char`\"{}, \char`\"{}product\+\_\+info\char`\"{}\mbox{]}, etc.

model(vendor) Get a list of models for a given vendor.

track(data) Track a series of requests from a user. Tracking requests allows you to get better statistics from handsetdetection.\+com.

data -\/ a dictionary containing a User-\/\+Agent, I\+P address, x-\/wap-\/profile, and any other information that may be useful in identifying the handset

vendor() Get a list of handset vendors.

You should also know about two methods of this A\+P\+I interface\+:

set\+\_\+v2\+\_\+apikey(apikey) Set a new A\+P\+I key. This is only necessary if you wish you use a new A\+P\+I key or have modified this package in a significant way.

set\+\_\+credentials(username, secret) Your username is the e-\/mail address you used when you signed up at handsetdetection.\+com.

The secret is the secret shown in your profile. It's your A\+P\+I version 2.\+0 secret -\/ not your A\+P\+I version 1.\+0 A\+P\+I\+Key.

For convenience, these methods are exposed as functions on the handsetdetection package. Should you desire additional flexibility, use the methods on the handsetdetection.\+Handset\+Detection class.

\subsection*{Examples }

There are four examples describing the module's use in the examples directory\+:\+:

detect.\+py Detect a mobile device and display the click-\/to-\/call and send-\/sms strings for the device. detect\+\_\+and\+\_\+redirect.\+py Detect a mobile device and redirect it to a new U\+R\+L. model.\+py For a given mobile device vendor, display known models. vendor.\+py Display known mobile device vendors.
